# Contributing Guidelines 📝

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Please follow these guidelines to keep the workflow smooth and organized.

## Branch Naming 🌱

- **Feature branches:** `feature/<short-description>` 🔥
- **Bugfix branches:** `bugfix/<short-description>` 🐛
- **Hotfix branches:** `hotfix/<short-description>` 🔧  
- **Experimental branches:** `experiment/<short-description>` 💡

> Use lowercase and hyphens for readability. The `<short-description>` should clearly describe the purpose of the branch.

---

## Commit Message Rules 📄

Use **imperative mood** in your commit messages. Examples:

- `Add user authentication endpoint`
- `Fix typo in README`
- `Update API documentation for endpoints`

Optional: You can use prefixes for clarity:

- `feat:` for new features  
- `fix:` for bug fixes  
- `docs:` for documentation  
- `refactor:` for code changes that do not fix a bug or add a feature  
- `test:` for adding or updating tests 

Example:  
- feat: add login endpoint
- fix: correct typo in CONTRIBUTING.md

## Pull Request Rules 👀

   - Open a **pull request** against the `develop` or main integration branch (not `  main` unless it’s a hotfix).  
   - PRs should have a **clear title** and **description** of the changes.  
   - Include **screenshots or examples** if the PR affects UI or functionality.  
   - Link any **related issues** using `#issue_number`.  
   - **Do not merge your own PR**—let another team member review it first.  

---

## Merge Rules 🛠️

- Only **approved PRs** should be merged.  
- Use **squash and merge** or **rebase and merge** to keep history clean.  
- Delete the branch after merging to avoid clutter.
